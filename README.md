# pyGIMLi related notebooks

As Jupyter notebooks are excellent for documentating and teaching, we collect here notebooks for solutions using pyGIMLi. Some might have made or will make it to examples or tutorials on https://pygimli.org, others might be here just not to be forgotten. Explicitly, solutions to issues raised in the gimli issue tracker might help to follow the problems and solutions more easily and we try to link them from the issues.

There are also collections of rather basic notebook that have been prepared for the Transform conferences in 2021 and 2022:
* https://github.com/gimli-org/transform2021
* https://github.com/gimli-org/transform2022
They provide first steps into pyGIMLi but also more sophisticated solutions like spectral inversion using pyBERT.

For the special case of timelapse ERT there is another, dedicated, repository https://github.com/gimli-org/timelapseERT
