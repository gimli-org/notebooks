# pyGIMLi related notebooks

As Jupyter notebooks are excellent for documentating and teaching, we collect here notebooks for solutions using pyGIMLi. Some might make it to examples or tutorials, others might be here just not to be forgotten. Explicitly, solutions to issues raised in the gimli issue tracker might help to follow the problems and solutions more easily.
